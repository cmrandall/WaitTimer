# WaitTimer
UCC Wait Timer


This is a custom built estimated wait timer created for local hospital. The hospital needed a solution in which people could see an estimated exptected wait time at each of the 4 urgent care locations to help improve their experience with their visits. This application allows for better care and faster appointments when the patient decides to go to a location with a shorter estimated wait time.

Technologies used here:

1. C# is used on the backend to pull data from the database and creates an XML file
2. XML file generated by the above C# program to display on the frontend application
3. JavaScript and AJAX is used to fetch the XML data and format it to be displayed on the front-end
4. HTML and CSS to generate the section on the page for the application to be displayed and to style it
